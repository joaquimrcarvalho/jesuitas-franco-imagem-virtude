## What is Timelink?

Timelink, formerly known as MHK (Micro History with Kleio) is an information system designed for processing person related information collected from historical sources. 

Timelink provides:

* a notation (kleio) for textual transcription of historical sources, capable of capturing complex information about people and their relations in any type of historical documents.
* a text processor that extracts information from the kleio transcriptions, infers personal attributes and relations from agent roles in historical events and generates data in formats suitable for database import.
* a database management system capable of processing time varying attributes and relations, assist in reconstructing biographies and networks from fragmentary information.
